(Assume that all other substances in the marble sample react with neither hydrochloric acid nor sodium hydroxide solution.) (Relative atomic masses: C = 12.0, O = 16.0, Ca = 40.1)\n\nQuestion analysis: After adding marble to excess HCl, HCl will react with marble and the volume will decrease. To calculate the mass of marble, titrate the solution formed with NaOH to measure the amount of HCl leftover, since only HCl reacts with NaOH. After that, subtract the initial volume from the final volume and find the amount of HCl used.

All liquid alkanes are less dense than water and thus float on water.\nChemical properties of alkanes\nAlkanes are unreactive because the C-C and C-H bonds are strong and difficult to break.\nAll alkanes have similar chemical properties. Higher members of alkanes usually react more slowly than lower members.\nCombustion\nWith sufficient supply of oxygen, complete combustion occurs\nReaction with halogens(Substitution reaction)\nIn the presence of sunlight/UV light/heat, alkane reacts with halogens(dissolved in an organic solvent), the orange/brown bromine solution decolourised slowly and steamy fumes are produced. \nThe reaction between them is a substitution reaction.\nChemical equations(e.g. Methane + chlorine dissolved in CH3CCl3):\nCH4 + Cl2 \u2192 CH3Cl + HCl\nCH3 + Cl2 \u2192 CH2Cl2 + HCl\nCH2Cl2 + Cl2 \u2192 CHCl3 + HCl\nCHCl3 + Cl2 \u2192 CCl4 + HCl\nThis is a chain reaction which is uncontrollable\nA mixture of products will be produced, including CH3Cl, CH2Cl2, CHCl3, CCl4, HCl.\nIf Cl2 is in excess, CCl4 will be the major product.\nIf CH4 is in excess, CH3Cl will be the major product.\nCl2 reacts faster with methane than Br2 does, as reactivity of halogen decreases down the group\n\nRemark:\nEnergy(light or heat) must be supplied for the reaction to take place. It is used to break the strong Br-Br bond, in order to form bromine free radical(Br \u2022) to initiate the reaction.\nA free radical is an atom or a group of atoms with at least one unpaired electron. It is highly reactive and exists only momentarily because the outermost electron shell of the chlorine radicals doesn\u2019t have a stable octet structure.\nWe usually use Br2 in organic solvent or bromine water (Br2(aq)), because pure bromine liquid is very toxic.\n\n\nUse electron diagram to illustrate monosubstitution of methane with chlorine\nInitiation > Propagation > Termination\nInitiation\nThe energy supplied by UV light breaks the Cl-Cl bonds in chlorine molecules to form chlorine free radicals.\nCl2 \u2192 light \u2192 2Cl\u2022\nPropagation \nEach chlorine radical combines with a hydrogen atom from a methane molecule to form a methyl radical and a hydrogen chloride molecule.\nCH4 + Cl\u2022 \u2192 CH3\u2022 + HCl\nSome of the methyl radicals then combine with chlorine atoms from other chlorine molecules to form chloromethane molecules and chlorine radicals.\nCH3\u2022 + Cl2 \u2192 CH3Cl + Cl3\u2022\nTermination \nTwo chlorine radicals combine to form a chlorine molecule.\n2Cl\u2022 \u2192 Cl2\nA methyl radical combines with a chlorine radical to form a chloromethane molecule.\nCH3\u2022 + Cl\u2022 \u2192 CH3Cl\nTwo methyl radicals combine to form an ethane molecule.\n2CH3\u2022 \u2192 CH3CH3\nThe products formed from the monosubstitution of methane with chlorine: CH3Cl, CH3CH3 and HCl\n\nCracking reaction\nWhy is refinery gas not widely used as fuel for motor cars though it is more flammable than petrol?\nThe supply of refinery gas is much lower than that of petrol.\nIt is used as raw materials for producing other chemicals, but petrol is not.\nCracking is the breaking down of large hydrocarbon molecules into smaller ones.\nImportance of cracking \nTo produce extra petrol\nTo produce alkene to make plastics, detergents, etc.\nCracking on an industrial scale\nReaction condition: absence of oxygen, otherwise may cause combustion)\nThe producers of cracking are generally alkane(<C10) and alkene.

Furthermore, the catalyst used is inexpensive.\n\nCracking in the laboratory\n\nProcess:\nWhen heated, the paraffin vapour will pass over the hot unglazed porcelain slowly.\nThe paraffin vapour will crack on the surface of hot porcelain.\nRemarks:\nHeat the porcelain but not paraffin. Otherwise the paraffin oil will vapourize too fast and hence pass through the catalysts without being cracked.\nThe delivery tube should be removed first before removing the heat source.

The polarity of the B\u2013Cl bonds cancel out each other, so BCl3 molecule is non-polar.\n\nEffect of charged rod on polar and non-polar liquids\nIf the jet is deflected towards the rod, the liquid contains polar molecules.\nIf the jet shows no deflection, it contains only non-polar molecules.\nIf a positively/negatively charged rod is used, the negative/positive ends of the polar molecules are attracted to the rod.\nChapter 26: Intermolecular forces\n\nIntermolecular forces\nThe electrostatic attractions between molecules are called intermolecular forces.\nVan der Waals\u2019 forces / hydrogen bond\nThey\u2019re much weaker than ionic bonds and covalent bonds.\n\nVan der Waals\u2019 force\nIt exists between all molecules, no matter polar or not.\nVan der Waals\u2019 forces in polar molecules\ne.g. HCl molecule\nThe positive end of an HCl molecule will be attracted to the negative end of another HCl molecule.\nVan der Waals\u2019 force in non-polar molecules(Dispersion forces)\ne.g. N2 molecule\nThe electrons in the molecule are in constant motion. At any given instant of time, the electron distribution may be uneven. The side with more electrons has a partial negative charge and the other side has a partial positive charge.\n\nFactors affecting the strength of van der Waals\u2019 forces\nMolecular size\nNumber of electrons, change of the uneven distribution of electrons, strength of van der Waals\u2019 forces and boiling point increase. \n(F2\u2192Cl2\u2192Br2\u2192I2) According to the order, as the molecular size of the molecules increases, the van der Waals\u2019 forces between molecules become stronger.\nAlthough relative atomic mass is proportional to size, don\u2019t compare their size while they\u2019re containing the similar relative atomic masses.\nMolecular shape \nWhen the area of contact between molecules increases, the strength of van der Waals\u2019 forces and boiling point increases.\ne.g. pentane(C5H12) v.s. dimethylpropane(C5H12)\nPentane molecules are rod-shaped while dimethylpropane molecules are spherical in shape. Pentane has a greater area of contact between molecules, the van der Waals\u2019 forces between molecules are stronger than those between dimethylpropane molecules.\nMolecular polarity\nThe strength of van der Waals\u2019 forces increases when the molecules are more polar.\ne.g. cis-1,2-dichloroethene(polar) v.s. trans-1,2-dichloroethene(non-polar)\nCis-1,2-dichloroethene is polar while trans-1,2-dichloroethene is non-polar. The van der Waals\u2019 forces between cis-1,2-dichloroethene molecules are stronger than those between trans-1,2-dichloroethene molecules.\n\nHydrogen bonding\nEvidence of hydrogen bonding\nNH3, H2O and HF have exceptionally high boiling points.\nFormation of hydrogen bonding\nHydrogen bond is the electrostatic force between a partially positively charged H atom and the lone pair of electrons of a highly electronegative atom(N, O, F) of another molecule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect of hydrogen bonding on physical properties of water and ethanol\nWater\nHigh boiling point\nThere is extensive hydrogen bonding between water molecules. A lot of energy is needed to overcome the hydrogen bonds between water molecules.\nHigh surface tension\nH2O molecules are held together by extensive hydrogen bonds.\nHigh viscosity\nH2O molecules are held together by extensive hydrogen bonds. H2O molecules cannot move past one another easily.\nEthanol(CH3CH2OH)\nRelatively high boiling point\nEthanol molecules are held together by extensive hydrogen bonds. Hence, a large amount of energy is needed to overcome the hydrogen bonds between ethanol molecules.\nHigh viscosity\nEthanol molecules are held together by extensive hydrogen bonds.\nSoluble in water\nAs ethanol has hydroxyl group(\u2013OH), so it can form hydrogen bonds with H2O molecules.\n\nComparing the strengths of van der Waals\u2019 forces, hydrogen bonding and covalent bonding\nHydrogen bond is stronger than van der Waals\u2019 force, but much weaker than covalent bond.\nThe stronger the intermolecular focus in the liquid, the longer time it takes the liquid to evaporate.\n\nChapter 27: Structures and properties of ice\n\nProperties of ice\nDensity\nIce has a lower density than liquid water.\nIn ice, each water molecule can form four hydrogen bonds with four neighbouring water molecules tetrahedrally. The tetrahedral arrangement of water molecules repeats to form an open structure of ice. When ice melts, water molecules have relative motions and this makes the open structure collapse. Hence, water molecules are packed more closely. As a result, ice is less dense than liquid water.\nMelting point\nIce has a relatively high melting point compared with substances of similar relative atomic mass.\nIn ice, water molecules are held together by extensive and relatively strong hydrogen bonds. When ice melts, a lot of energy is needed to overcome a certain amount of hydrogen bonds between water molecules.\n",

(e.g. CH2=CHCH2CH3 & CH3CH=CHCH3)\nFunctional group isomerism\nFunctional group isomers have the same molecular formula but different functional groups.\nThey have totally different physical and chemical properties as their functional groups are different.\n\nStereoisomerism\nStereoisomerism occurs when there are compounds in which atoms are joined in the same order but have a different spatial arrangement.\nCis-trans isomerism\nCis-trans isomerism occurs when there are stereoisomers resulting from restricted rotation about carbon-carbon double bonds.\n#Carbon-carbon single bonds can rotate freely. Thus, often they would have the same spatial arrangement of atoms. (same molecules).\nCis-trans isomerism is found only in alkenes that have two different atoms or groups of atoms attached to each doubly-bonded carbon atom.\nCis-isomers\nTrans-isomers\nThe same atoms/group of atoms are on the same sider of the double bond.\nThe same atoms/group of atoms are on the opposite side of the double bond.\n\nPhysical properties\nBoiling point (depends on strength of intermolecular forces with polarity)\nMelting point (mainly depends on packing efficiency with the symmetrical structure)\n\nEnantiomerism\nEnantiomerism occurs when there are two stereoisomers that are mirror images of one another but are not superimposable.\n\nAchiral molecule (symmetric)\nChiral molecule (asymmetric)\n- The C atom is attached to 4 atoms or groups of atoms, but at least 2 attached atoms/groups of atoms are the same.\n- Achiral molecule has at least one plane of symmetry.\n- Achiral molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n- The C atom is attached to 4 different atoms or groups of atoms, which is called the chiral center.\n- Chiral molecules have no plane of symmetry.\n- Chiral molecule is not superimposable in its mirror image.\n- Chiral molecules have enantiomers.\n\n\nChemical properties\nEnantiomers have the same chemical properties except the reaction with another chiral molecule.\nPhysical properties\nEnantiomers have very similar (identical) physical properties. They have the same boiling point, melting point, density etc.\nThe only difference is that they have different interactions on place-polarized light.\nTwo enantiomers can rotate the place of polarization of a beam of plane polarized light to opposite directions to the same extent\n(+)-isomer: rotate the plane of polarization in clockwise direction..\n(-)-isomer: rotate the plane of polarization in an anticlockwise direction.\nChiral molecules are always said to be optical active. This property is called optical activity.\nThe optical activity can be measured by using a polarimeter.\nChapter 46: Important organic substances\n\nAcetylsalicylic acid (aspirin)\nStructure\nAcetylsalicylic acid aka aspirin\nFunctional groups: carboxyl group and ester group\nAspirin decomposes gradually when exposed to damp air. This is because the ester group of its molecules react with moisture in the air.\nMedical applications\nSmall doses of aspirin\nRelieve pains/painkiller\nReduce inflammation and fever\nReduce the risk of heart attack and strokes\nSide-effects\nstomach lining bleeding and slow blood clotting\nMg(OH)2 is weakly basic, which is used to neutralize any excess acid in the stomach caused by the aspirin and avoid irritation to the stomach.\nAlternatives to aspirin (Paracetamol/acetaminophen)\nFunctional groups: amide group and hydroxyl group\nParacetamol reduces fever but doesn\u2019t have the anti-inflammatory action of aspirin\nParacetamol has few side effects and seldom affects the functions of other drugs\n\nSoaps and soapless detergents\nA detergent is a substance which improves the cleansing properties of water. (toothpaste, soap, face cleansing foam, shampoo & washing powder)\nHydrophobic hydrocarbon tail (soluble in oil)\nHydrophilic ionic head (soluble in water)\nDetergent anions are attracted to both water and oil molecules\nOnce dissolved in water, sodium ions are separated from the ionic heads and don\u2019t participate in the cleansing action of soaps and soapless detergents.\nComparison\n\n\nSoapy detergent/soap\nSoapless detergent/synthetic detergent\nSource\nmade of saponification of animal fats (beef fat) and vegetable oils (olive oil and coconut oil)\nmade from hydrocarbons derived from petroleum\nStructure\nNa/K salts of long-chained carboxylic acids (fatty acid)\nThey don\u2019t contain salts of fatty acids\nIonic head\ncarboxylate group (\u2013-COO-)\nsulphonate group (\u2013SO3-) / \nsulphate group (\u2013O\u2013SO3-)\n\n\nMaking soap by saponification\nSource: fats or oils (soap, laundry soap and liquid soap)\nReaction: saponification\nHeat fat/oil with concentrated NaOH(aq) gently with stirring \nAdd saturated NaCl(aq) to the hot mixture with stirring (This process is called \u2018salting-out\u2019. As much of the soap formed dissolves in water, the saturated NaCl(aq) reduces the solubility of soap in water.)\nA white, creamy solid (soap) forms which floats on the solution surface. Collect it by filtration later.\n\nMaking soapless detergent\nSource: petroleum (washing powder, dish-washing liquid, shampoo)\nReaction: Hydrocarbons is first treated with concentrated sulphuric acid, followed by NaOH(aq)\n\nTwo properties of detergents\nWetting property\nDetergent acts as a wetting agent/surfactant, which can reduce the surface tension of water, so water can spread over any surface and wet the surface more easily\nThe ionic head of the detergent dissolve in the water droplet\nThe ionic head will separate H2O molecules and weaken the hydrogen bonds between nearby H2O molecules\nWater molecules are held less tightly, so the surface tension of water drop decreases.\nEmulsifying property\nDetergent acts as emulsifying agent, which can break up oil into droplets and the droplets suspended in water to form stable emulsion\nThe detergent has an ionic head, which is hydrophilic and a hydrocarbon tail which is hydrophobic.\nThe ionic head will dissolve in water and the hydrocarbon tail will dissolve in oil/grease.\nH2O molecules attract the ionic heads and bring the oil into water.\nBy stirring, oil droplets are formed which carry negative charges.\nThe ionic heads of the oil droplets repel from each other and the droplets cannot join together again.\nThe dirt inside the oil droplets are then removed by washing.\nDetergent particles with 12 to 20 carbon atoms in their hydrocarbon tail have good detergent properties.\n\nNylon and polyesters\nCondensation\nTwo or more molecules join together to form a larger molecules, with the elimination of small molecules\nEsterification is a condensation reaction.\n\nCondensation polymerization\nCondensation polymerization is a reaction in which monomer molecules join together to form polymer molecules with the elimination of small molecules.\nCriteria of monomer: Must have functional groups at both ends. (\u2260both functional groups are the same)\nThe polymer formed is called condensation polymers.\n\n\nNylon\nThe monomers of polyamides are linked by amide linkages.\nNylon 6.6 is the most popular type of nylon.\nThe first \u20186\u2019 = number of C atoms in the diamine molecule\nThe second \u20186\u2019 = number of C atoms in the dioic acid molecule.\nFormation of nylon 6.6\nn H2N(CH2)6NH2 + n HOOC(CH2)4COOH \u2192 [\u2212CO(CH2)4CONH(CH2)6NH\u2212]n + 2n-1 H2O\nIf hexanedioyl dichloride instead of hexanedioic acid is used, HCl is eliminated but not H2O\nProperties\nTough, very strong and elastic\nWater/oil-proof\nCan be easily cleaned and dyed\nUses\nRopes, fishing lines & badminton racket strings\n\nPolyester\nThe monomers are linked by ester linkages.\nPoly/PET/Terylene/Dacron is kind of polyester.\nProperties\nStrong, tough and smooth\nResistant to water and most chemicals\nLow density\nUses\nMaking fibres, clothes, sails, bottles for water and drinks.\n",
  "T12": "Chapter 47: Periodic variation in physical properties of the elements from Li to Ar\n\nElements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number and in groups and periods, in the modern Periodic Table.\n\nPeriodic variations in structure and bonding across periods 2 and 3\nMetals \u2192 Semi-metals \u2192 non-metals\nThe metallic character of elements generally decreases.\nThe bonding of elements changes from metallic bonds to covalent bonds.\nThe structure of elements changes from giant metallic structures to giant covalent structures, and eventually to simple molecular structures.\nB and Si are semi-metals which have giant covalent structures.\n\nInterpreting the variation in melting point of elements across a period\nAcross a period, the melting point of elements rises from Group I to a maximum in Group IV. Then it drops sharply to Group V, and reaches a minimum in Group 0\nAcross period 2 (Li \u2192 Be) & period 3 (Na \u2192 Al)\nThey all have giant metallic structures.\nThe number of delocalized electrons participating in metallic bond formation increases.\nThe strength of metallic bonds increases. Hence the melting point increases.\nB, C and Si have very high melting points\nThey all have giant covalent structures.\nAtoms are held together by strong covalent bonds in their structures.\nAcross period 2 (N \u2192 Ne) & period 3 (P \u2192 Ar)\nThey all have simple molecular structures.\nPeriod 2: Molecular size: N2 > O2 > F2 > Ne\nPeriod 3: Molecular size: S8 > P4 > Cl2 > Ar\nThe strength of van der Waals\u2019 forces increases as the molecular size increases.\nTherefore, the melting points also increase.\nMelting point: N2 > O2, but boiling point: O2 > N2 (fractional distillation of liquified air)\n\nInterpreting the variation in electrical conductivity of elements across a period\nAcross period 2 (Li \u2192 Be) & period 3 (Na \u2192 Al)\nThey all have giant metallic structures.\nAs the number of delocalized electrons increases, the electrical conductivity increases.\nC(diamond) and silicon don\u2019t conduct electricity\nAll of their outermost shell electrons are used for the formation of covalent bonds, so there are no delocalized electrons in their structures.\nIn graphite, only three of its four outermost shell electrons in each carbon atom are sussed for forming covalent bonds, leaving one electron available for delocalization. So graphite conducts electricity.\nSilicon is a semi-metal. At higher temperatures, more electrons gain energy and become delocalized. It will become a good conductor of electricity in that specific condition.\nAcross period 2 (N \u2192 Ne) & period 3 (P \u2192 Ar) \nThey are non-conductors of electricity.\nThey all have simple molecular structures, their molecules have no delocalized electrons.\nChapter 48: Bonding, behaviour in water and acid-base properties of the oxides of elements from Na to Cl\n\nProperties of oxides of Period 3 elements\n\n\nGroup\n\n\nI\nII\nIII\nIV\nV\nVI\nVII\nElements\nNa\nMg\nAl\nSi\nP\nS\nCl\nIts oxide\nNa2O\nMgO\nAl2O3\nSiO2\nP4O10\nSO2\nCl2O\nBonding\nIonic bond\nCovalent bond\nStructure\nGiant ionic \nGiant covalent\nSimple molecular\nM.p.\nHigh\nVery high\nLow\nElectrical Conductivity\nYes (in molten state/aqueous solution)\nNo\nSolubility\nYes\nNo (slightly)\nNo\nYes\nAcid-base\nBasic oxide\nAmphoteric oxide\nAcidic oxide\n\n\nBehaviour of the oxides of elements from Na to Cl in water\nNa2O is soluble in water.
